 <h1>This is my online Resume</h1>
    <p>Hey, my name is Matthias Philipp, I am from cologne in west germany. I am currently doing a training
        to become a media designer. I am learning media design, but I wouldnt say my strength lies in designing.<br>
        Last year after the corona pandemic I wasnt sure where to continue my journey of life and to be honest
        I was scared to start over as an IT dude again, so I decided to go with designing,<br>
        although I knew 
        that creativity isnt something I was used to and I realized in the last year that I am more into
        the technical stuff.<br>
        That's why I am focusing on doing Web development for now. At the moment I am
        doing the udemy course of Angela Yu and this is my first capstone project. <br>

        So be very welcome to my Resume - Website and dont be frightened by the bad Design. This Website is supposed
        to be made with HTML which is only made for the structure not the good looking fun part, jfyi :)
